# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

 The goal of this project was to follow web acessibility standards to ensure that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.

## Accessibility standards

- Semantic HTML elements
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Accessible alt attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Title elements are concise, descriptive titles

---
## Notes

### HTML Structure

- The ``<header>`` is usually the **first** HTML element in the code. It acts as an **introduction** to the webpage, with the logo, a tagline, and navigation links.
- As opposed to the header, the ``<footer>`` is usually the last element of a page, where the main navigation links are repeated and secondary ones added.
- The ``<main>`` element contains, as its name suggests, the most important content of the page, the one that defines the purpose of the page.
- The ``<aside>`` element usually lives alongside the main and contains additional information related to the main content.
- The ``<section>`` element allows to group
- ``<nav>`` as a list of links that go to the different pages of the website.
