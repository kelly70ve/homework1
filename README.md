# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Onof standardse of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set  or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.

Your task is to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible. An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the Scout Rule:

> Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve their codebase for long term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

[] ``semantic HTML elements``
[] elements follow a ``logical structure independent of styling`` and positioning
[] accessible ``alt`` attributes
[] the ``heading attributes`` fall in ``sequential order``
[] title elements are concise, ``descriptive title``

## Review

You are required to submit the following for review:

* The URL of the deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.


# HTML Structure

- The ``<header>`` is usually the **first** HTML element in the code. It acts as an **introduction** to the webpage, with the logo, a tagline, and navigation links.
- As opposed to the header, the ``<footer>`` is usually the last element of a page, where the main navigation links are repeated and secondary ones added.
- The ``<main>`` element contains, as its name suggests, the most important content of the page, the one that defines the purpose of the page.
- The ``<aside>`` element usually lives alongside the main and contains additional information related to the main content.
- The ``<section>`` element allows to group
- ``<nav>`` as a list of links that go to the different pages of the website.
